# Basic Data Structures Project
### This project was developed as part of a university course, aiming to provide a classical approach to software solution development for medium-sized problems. It serves as a reference for implementations of dynamic data structures, file storage, and modularization.

## Objective
#### The objective of this project is to provide a solid foundation for students and professionals who wish to understand and apply data structure concepts in their own projects. The implementation of the solutions presented here follows common software development practices, aiming for code clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.

## Content
#### The project covers a variety of basic data structures such as lists, queues, stacks, among others, and demonstrates how to use them to solve real-world problems. Additionally, file storage techniques for data persistence and modularization for promoting code reuse and organization are presented.

## Contribution
#### If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or new features to add, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request. Your contribution is greatly appreciated!
